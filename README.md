# Corporate Event Planner

## Project Name: Corporate Event Planner

### Description
#### Pitch: 
App to keep track of all your corporate event planning details! There are so many details and people to coordinate with. This app helps solve these problems.

This app contains one user type- a corporate event planner.  
* Onboarding process for event planner. Include their company, role and e-mail.
* Home Page - After a user logs in, they'll be directed to their page where they can view cards of their past and current events they are planning. They can click into an event to view full screen or edit or delete info.
* Navigation - Navigation is present on all pages.
* Create Post Page - Allow a user to create a new event to plan.  New event fields might include event name, description, date and time, and budget. You can add a list of vendors you need to maintain relationships with, and create a shopping or to do list with the ability to mark off items as done. When saved you can view a preview of the event on the homepage.
* Single event page. View a single event in full screen. Include functional buttons to edit and delete data.  View the to-do list/shopping list, and list of vendors.

Stretch Goal: Invite other co-workers by e-mail to join the project, with ability to edit it as well. On the single event page, add ability to add comments to each vendor on the list to track conversations and notes.
